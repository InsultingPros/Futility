 *  # `CommandAnnouncer`
 *
 *      Simple class to simplify announcements of changes made by Futility's
 *  commands. Allows to announnce different messages to self, target and others;
 *  changing them up when self coincides with target.
 *      Technically only for reporting successes, since failures are only
 *  reported to the instigator and are, therefore, simple. But for the sake of
 *  consistency, every report can be placed here.
 *
 *  ## Usage
 *
 *  There is supposed to be a separate announcer class for every command class,
 *  so there's two steps to setting one up: creating new class and putting it
 *  to proper use.
 *
 *  ### Creating new `CommandAnnouncer` class
 *
 *  Step by step the process is:
 *      1. Declare a new class, extending `CommandAnnouncer`;
 *      2. Declare iinside `AnnouncementVariations` field variables for every
 *          announcement;
 *      3. Declare a `Finalizer()` and place a `FreeVariations(...);` line for
 *          each announcement variable inside. Don't forget to later also make
 *          a `super.Finalizer();` call;
 *      4. For every announcement make a separate method that accepts values to
 *          be included in that announcement as arguments.
 *      5. Inside that method check whether corresponding announcement variable
 *          was already initialized (`initialized` field in side
 *          `AnnouncementVariations` struct) and otherwise initialize all
 *          contained `TextTemplate`s.
 *      6. Fill every template with passed arguments ("instigator" and "target"
 *          arguments are auto-filled later). For that you can use auxiliary
 *          method `MakeArray()`, e.g.
 *          ```unrealscript
 *          local int                   i;
 *          local array<TextTemplate>   templates;
 *          // ...
 *          templates = MakeArray(gainedDosh);
 *          for (i = 0; i < templates.length; i += 1) {
 *              templates[i].Reset().ArgInt(doshAmount);
 *          }
 *          ```
 *      7. Make a `MakeAnnouncement()`, passing it `AnnouncementVariations` that
 *          you've just (initialized and) filled with arguments.
 *
 *  ### Using created `CommandAnnouncer` class
 *
 *      Simply allocate variable of that class, make a `Setup()` call inside
 *  `Executed()` and `ExecutedFor()` (only necessary to do in the one you are
 *  using).
 *      Since it is way more efficient to only allocate such variable once
 *  (avoiding creating templates every time), it is recommended that you create
 *  it inside `BuildData()` call and remember that instance in a field variable.
 *  You then simply need to declare command's finalizer to deallocate it.
 *  Just don't forget to call `super.Finalizer()` as well.
