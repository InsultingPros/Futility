[default FutilityNicknames]
;       This feature allows to configure nickname limitations for the server.
;       It allows you to customize vanilla limitations for nickname length and
;   color with those of your own design. Enabling this feature overwrites
;   default behaviour.
autoEnable=true
;   How to treat whitespace characters inside players' nicknames.
;       * `NSA_DoNothing` - does nothing, leaving whitespaces as they are;
;       * `NSA_Trim` - removes leading and trailing whitespaces for nicknames;
;       * `NSA_Simplify` - removes leading and trailing whitespaces
;           for nicknames, also reducing a sequence of whitespaces inside
;           nickname to a single space, e.g. "my   nick" becomes "my nick".
;   Default is `NSA_DoNothing`, same as on vanilla.
spacesAction=NSA_DoNothing
;   How to treat colored nicknames.
;       * `NCP_ForbidColor` - completely strips down any color from nicknames;
;       * `NCP_ForceTeamColor` - forces all nicknames to have player's current
;           team's color;
;       * `NCP_ForceSingleColor` - allows nickname to be painted with a single
;           color (sets nickname's color to that of the first character);
;       * `NCP_AllowAnyColor` - allows nickname to be colored in any way player
;           wants.
;   Default is `NCP_ForbidColor`, same as on vanilla.
colorPermissions=NCP_ForbidColor
;       Set this to `true` if you wish to replace all whitespace characters with
;   underscores and `false` to leave them as is.
;       Default is `true`, same as on vanilla. However there is one difference:
;   Futility replaces all whitespace characters (including tabulations,
;   non-breaking spaces, etc.) instead of only ' '.
replaceSpacesWithUnderscores=true
;   Max allowed nickname length. Negative values disable any length limits.
; 
;   NOTE: `0` resets all nicknames to be empty and, if `correctEmptyNicknames`
;   is set to `true`, they will be replaced with one of the fallback nicknames
;   (see `correctEmptyNicknames` and `fallbackNickname`).
maxNicknameLength=20
;   Should we replace empty player nicknames with a random fallback nickname
;   (defined in `fallbackNickname` array)?
correctEmptyNicknames=true
;   Array of fallback nicknames that will be used to replace any empty nicknames
;   if `correctEmptyNicknames` is set to `true`.
